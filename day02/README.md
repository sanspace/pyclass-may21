## Practice

  - Accept a list of numbers from user and
    - print a sum of those values
    - print minimum value
    - print only unique values from those
    - print the list of numbers in ascending order
    - print the list of numbers in descending order
  
  - Write a name creator app
    - Ask user's first name
    - Ask user's last name
    - Print like `Firstname Lastname` (capialized first and last names)

  - Accept 2 lists of numbers from user and
    - print numbers present in both the lists
    - print numbers in one list and not another and vice versa

## Extra Mile

  - Try reversing the name app above
    - Accept a name from a user
