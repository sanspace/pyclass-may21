## Practice

  - Python Environment. If you have trouble in your local machine, try online sites like https://replit.com/
  - Code Editor / IDE (personal preferene)
  - Github account and repo (this is where you'll push following programs)
    - Needless to say, no personal/company (empID, project etc.) data on Github.
    - If you need help with git and github, try this: https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-github-6235f5ae3a0b
    - Try to have a github repo up for the assignments and have day wise folders similar to this repo.
  - Programs
    - Given a string `python`, try printing `cython` using slicing `[start:stop]` and concatenation. `+`
    - Given any file python file (like `something.py`) use slicing to
       - print the extension alone (`py` - don't include `.`)
       - print the file name (`something`)
