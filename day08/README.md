## Practice

  - Try converting your existing for statements into generators
  - Convert your existing list comprehensions into generator expressions where applicable
  - Create a separate repo and use pipenv to manage a 3rd party package
  - Write a class
    - implement equivalent dunder methods for
      - str()
      - len()
      - repr()
  - create a seaparate repo using pipenv and leverage your fav package from PyPI

## Extra Mile

  - try writing one of the in-built classes (str, int or anything of your choice) by yourself. Choose to implement some/all of the functionalities of it.
