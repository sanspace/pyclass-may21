## Practice

  - Given a list of names, try printing unique names that are less than 5 character length and do not contain the character 'e'.
    - names = ["john", "jake", "jack", "george", "jenny", "jason"]
  - Given a dictionary {"name": "python", "ext": "py", "creator": "guido"}, print both keys and values.
  - Implement FizzBuzz (look it up if you're not familiar with it) in Python
  - Guessing Game. Accept a guess number and tell us if it's higher or less than the hardcoded number
  - Loop over a dict and print the value and key in the format value belongs to key.  

## Extra Mile

  - Modify the Guessing Game to allow 3 tries for the user to guess the number right.
