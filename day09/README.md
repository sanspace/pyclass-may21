## Practice

  - Write a demo program on each to highlight your fav feature from one of the standar libs we have seen
    - Collections - demo Counter
    - itertools - demo combinations
    - functools - demo cache
    - contextlib - demo suppress
    - use type hints
    - run your program with mypy and make sure it's error free
    - run black and observe the changes it makes
    - run flake8 and see what are all the findings are

## Extra Mile

  - re-write your existing programs to improvise them with the latest learnings
    - use type hints
    - run em with mypy, black and flake8
