## A review of basics

  - Everything is an object in Python
  - functions are first class objects
  - functions can be passed like other parameters
  - function object vs function call (the paranthesis!)
  - functions can return functions
  - functions can have inner functions
  - Scope LEGB (Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in)
  - inner functions can have access to enclosed scope even after the enclosed functions lifetime
